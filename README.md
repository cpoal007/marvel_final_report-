# MARVEL GENERIC TASK FINAL REPORT 
This is my final report of the tasks i had done at marvel for the completion of generic task section
## TASK 1: Speed Control of DC Motor
I started my tasks with this one , as it seemed interesting  and easy .  I  learned about how the ardunio board works when we put some simple code . I previously had no idea on how this particular thing works , so i went through the reference which was provided to me in the given pdf, seeing it i did the connections and some alteration finally it started working .
